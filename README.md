# Typing-Tutor
This project was part of my coursework in my second year of study. It involved extending a multithreaded educational “Typing Tutor” game coded in Java, with the goal of increasing understanding of thread synchronization and thread safety. The game challenges the player to type in the falling words before they hit the bottom of the screen. As part of the project, two new features were added to the existing game without breaking the existing code: ensuring that the lowest word disappears first when duplicate words appear on the screen, and a green word (Hungry Word) that moves horizontally across the middle of the screen and causes any words it bumps into to disappear. Though this project, I gained experience in working with multithreaded programs and implementing thread synchronization. I have also included the report I wrote with the changes I maade to the existing code we had.
